  <p> <b><center>The Term of Orphans in terms of Islamic Sharia:</b> According to term "syara," an orphan is a youngster whose father passed away before the child reached puberty. A youngster can only be referred to as an orphan until they hit puberty and turn into adults. Because they can already support and care for themselves, children who have grown up and then lost their parents are no longer referred to be orphans. Due of their inability to care for oneself and depend on others for support, it is only appropriate for children. </center></p>
  <p> <b><center>The word of God which means:</b> "For this reason, you should not despise orphans." (Al-Dhuha)

"Do you know people who deny religion, that is, people who scold orphans." (al-Maun)


Islam also forbids eating the property of orphans in a cruel way as stated in Surah An-Nisa verse 6. </center></p>
  <p> <b><center>According to Fath Al-Qarib and Al-Baijuri:</b> "A young child (under the age of 18) who is fatherless is referred to as an orphan, regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl or whether he has a grandfather. This includes minor children, offspring from an extramarital affair, offspring from a collection, and offspring who are refused because their parents are estranged.
    He is not referred to as an orphan after he enters puberty, which occurs when he is fifteen lunar years old."
    
    
    Another term used by the Malaysian Malay community is Yatim Piatu, which refers to people who have lost both their parents. However, this term is not used in Islamic law. Orphans are kids whose fathers passed away when they were young or immature, or both. Islam calls for people to treat orphans well, give them care and education, and grant them their legal rights.  </center></p>
  <p> <b><center>Social obligations:</b> Each and every Muslim has a social obligation to love and care for orphans. And it is one of the Islamic struggle's tasks that people hardly ever undertake. As a result, four factors contribute to social problems: disregard for orphans, failure to feed the hungry, greedy consumption of the natural world's bounty, and an unhealthy love of material belongings (see surah al-Fajr, verses 15-20).</p>  </center></p>
