	<p> <b><center>About us:</b>RUMAH BAKTI DATO' HARUN</center>
	<p> <b><center>History of "Rumah Bakti Dato' Harun":</b> On August 16, 1966, a group of community activists and top Selangor State Government officials successfully founded and registered the "Selangor Orphan Education Organization" under Registration Number ARS/Sel/50/66 out of a sense of duty and compassion for the orphans.

		The Committee has made rapid progress toward achieving the purpose for which it was formed with the approval of this registration. According to permission document number PHT.G.2/139/75, the Selangor State Government has given Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato' Haji Harun Idris and his wife Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Suleiman a 4.8-acre plot of land in Mukim Hulu Kelang (HS.231) in exchange for their services. The Chairman of this Organization Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato' Haji Harun Idris has been assigned to examine whether this project can be performed successfully.</center> </p>

	<p> <b><center>Programs and Activities:</b> They put a lot of effort into organising events like the Dinner Ceremony, the Premiere, and an appeal to the membership. As a result, the organisation successfully raised RM158,107.81 to build a House of Worship. DYMM The Sultan of Selangor, Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Alhaj ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah, has consented to serve as the organization's patron. In its initial phase, the recruitment of orphans began in 1976 with a total of 26 individuals, including 13 boys and 13 girls between the ages of 6 and 12. On March 5, 1977, His Majesty the Sultan of Selangor officially opened RBHK. The number of orphans has climbed every year, reaching an all-time high in 2023. There are currently 66 orphans living in Rumah Bakti, ranging in age from 7 to 17.

		Two new 2-story dormitory blocks were finished on March 2, 1982. The Selangor State Government and public donations contributed to the two dormitory blocks' RM600,000 value. In 1984, a surau was also built. A new surau was constructed to replace the old one in 2009. Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Sulaiman, the late Dato' Haji Harun Idris's wife, gave this new surau as a gift. In 1989, RBHK obtained a brand-new library. In 1997, this library was designated as a Resource Center. The 1984-built old surau was converted into a new Resource Center because RBHK now has a new surau.The library and the computer room are the two sections that make up the Resource Center.
		The members of the Selangor Orphan Education Organization have decided to change Rumah Bakti Hulu Kelang (RBHK) to Rumah Bakti Dato' Harun (RBDH), in honour of the late Y.Bhg Dato' Haji Harun Idris. The Rumah Bakti emblem has also been modified and approved by the Registrar of Societies on July 29, 2011. </center></p>
